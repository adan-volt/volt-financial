Rapid expansion followed, with new branches opening in Argentina (2016), Chile (2018), and Miami, Florida (2020), each location strengthening our mission and expertise in providing top-tier solar and energy storage solutions.

    In 2023, we recognized a growing need: to empower our clients not only with solar energy technology but also with accessible, flexible financing solutions for their energy independence. Thus, Volt Financial Services was created, emerging as a natural progression of Volt Solar Energy's commitment to sustainability and customer empowerment.
